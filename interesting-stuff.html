    <h2>Stuff I Find Interesting</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
        For his research but more importantly his writings on the ethics of cryptography & the place of technology in society check out <a href="https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/">Phillip Rogaway's site</a>, especially his sociopolitical essays.
    </li>

        <a href="https://weepingwitch.github.io/za.html">Angels</a> is one of my favourite very simple games. Conway's game of life is visited by an angel - can you spot her? Defocus your eyes and find the aberration in order.

        I am a very big fan of fish of all varieties so I have been convinced by my wonderful friend Peter (see webring) to add a page telling you about <a href="fish.html">my favourites</a>.

        I love Discworld, and Pratchett is even better with the <a href="https://www.lspace.org/books/apf/index.html">Annotated Pratchett File</a> as a companion. Check it out for extra comments/notes/explanations.

        Ever wanted to know what you learn in Clown School? I did. This <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/everything-you-learn-in-clown-college/">article</a> collects hilarious stories from performers of clown on their journeys and what they learnt.

        Find <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epdf/10.1243/PIME_PROC_1990_204_131_02">here</a> a fascinating article from 1989 on meta-materials in F1 cars. It gives great insight into the design/engineering/crash-testing of cars at the time.

        While I mostly listen to metal/emo/alternative I hold a place in my heart for instrumental music, especially in uncommon ways/combinations. <a href="https://lizardinthespring.bandcamp.com/track/a-quick-one-before-the-eternal-worm-devours-appalachia">Banjo + synths</a> was not a combo I expected to work, but it's incredible. Another instrumental song I'm currently obsessed with is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5Rq2hPEd7UWN6i9tME54dj?si=49638b64801d4813">Angelica</a> by Lamb (as recommended by my brother)

        The National Parks Service (of the US) has crochet patterns written by rangers. I have made the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/walleye-crochet-pattern.htm">Walleye</a> and the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/halibut-crochet-pattern.htm">Halibut</a> (one of my favourite fish).
    </li>

        Currently working on finding a better source, but for now just check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker#">Wikipedia page</a> for WWII Code Talkers. The Code Book by Simon Singh is a great source for more information if you can get your hands on it!

        I'm super not a fan of the concept of going in caves myself, but luckily Carla Kirby is because she's created this <a href="https://www.design42.com/caving/home.htm">wonderful site</a> filled with her own original images and thoughts of all things caves. Cool stuff!
