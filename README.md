Currently Planning to Add Next:

- Slightly better site navigation? Maybe
- More poems that I have collected in various places so I can keep them somewhere more centralised
- A minimal amount of responsive code or at least some padding. Anything to make the pages look *a little bit* better on different devices. I don't really care about design but I *do* care about accessibility. 
- update favourite fish page
- add a "learn less about me" page that produces misinformation
- sort out license
