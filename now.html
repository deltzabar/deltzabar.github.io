    <h2>Now</h2>

    <p>
        Right now I am:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Working on my final year project, which focuses on the KCA security of MACs, extending existing work on symmetric primitives. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Very much enjoying my modules on Advanced Functional Programming and Advanced Cryptography.
        </li>
        <li>
            (Sort of) writing a book. 70k words down, an amorphous amount yet to go...
        </li>
        <li>
            Most of the way through crocheting a halloween-themed jumper. Yes that's how long it's been going for. I'll finish it ... soon ...
        </li>
        <li>
            Working my way through Book Riot's <a href="https://bookriot.com/read-harder-2025/">Read Harder Challenge</a>. It was a lot of fun last year, and I hope to beat my record of 19 categories filled!
        </li>
        <li>
            Attempting to work out what I want to do after I graduate ...
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I ended up with too much stuff on media i'm interested in now, so this has been split off to a <a href="media.html">media page</a>.</p>
