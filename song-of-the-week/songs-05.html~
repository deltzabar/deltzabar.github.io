    <h3>Song of the Week w/c 24th March 2025</h3>

    <p>
      Alright, so, there isn't really a theme or a long story for this week, to be honest. But there <em>was</em> one song that really stood out to me due to how I listened to it 1 william times both this week and last week. So, that's the song of the week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6CoilzKoYntsgLtOiQfHGl?si=887f3d5ab9514914">Dump No Waste, Flows to the Sea</a> by Office Dog is probably my current favourite song right now.
