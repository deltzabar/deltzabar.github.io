    <h3>Song of the Week w/c 24th Feb 2025</h3>

    <p>
        Inspired (blatantly stolen) from my wonderful friend <a href="https://anna-maths.xyz/">Anna</a>, I am going to try my best to update my song of the week :) We'll see how long this lasts. This week, I've chosen St. Chroma from Tyler, The Creator. I used to listen to a lot of rap as a teen and I'd sort of fallen off of it for the last few years. It's been really fun recently to rediscover songs I used to love, but more importantly there's been some really exciting new stuff released. 
        Credits must go to Doechii for her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-91vymvIH0c">tiny desk concert</a> which was <i>so good</i> that it was definitely a big precipitator for this. A lot of songs from her recent mix tape were fighting to get on this week's song of the week, but in the end, Tyler won out. CHROMAKOPIA is really an incredible album (and I am certainly not the first person to say this), and I think St. Chroma is a microcosm of everything I love about it. 
        Lyrically & musically complex, heart-breaking, beautiful, and also just good fucking music. The way everything layers on the track is so delicious I just keep adding it back to my queue to listen over and over again. See you guys next week for more songs!
