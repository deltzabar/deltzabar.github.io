    <h3>Song of the Week w/c 3rd March 2025</h3>

    <p>
        This week, the song of the week is actually two songs, sorry! I could not make myself pick between them, and I think they both work quite well with my theme. 
        That's right! I decided I felt too weird picking things without a theme, so I have decided to also pick a theme for the week 
        (although I will be honest, it is quite circular as the songs have also informed the theme.)
    </p>

    <p>
        The theme this week is <strong>Joyful Returns</strong>, very much informed by my experience of stepping outside on Sunday morning and discovering, against all odds, that it was <em>warm</em>. 
        To quote myself, "holy fuck weather above 10Â° and sun got me feeling like I just took a tab of acid what the fuckkkk". 
        The signs of spring being upon us have been sprinkled all over the place - I've enjoyed seeing crocuses joyfully pressing themselves out of the ground, as well as the gradual return of colour to the plant life around me from the scrubby grey-brown of winter. 
        But seeing isn't the same as <em>feeling</em> - feeling the thrumming heartbeat of life returning in your bones as the warm fingers of the sun caress your face. 
        Point being, I am very much feeling the joy right now, and enjoying the pendulum swinging back up towards me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I considered a few songs that didn't make the cut - one of these is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4JIYKZzKnlPhL28h0uixzZ?si=638ac95324304a7e">Don't You Dare Forget the Sun</a> by Get Scared, an on-the-nose title for sure. 
        However, I felt the song itself didn't have quite the theme I was looking for, even though I do really enjoy it. 
        Another song that ended up on the chopping block was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0C9jZPUv4SuaXkuEQw6L40?si=cdbbe2b2a25b4072">I'm a Believer</a> by Smash Mouth. 
        There's something so silly and unapologetically joyous about it, it's just such good plain fun every time I listen to it.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end, I picked <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3LXVbTXhumz7ooByKvnuKD?si=9aceaf9f3fcc4ac5">Memories</a> by Panic! At the Disco as my first song. 
        I'm sure it will not be a surprise to anyone to discover that I was a massive emo kid, and <em>Vices & Virtues</em> was (and still is) one of my favourite albums. 
        Memories is just a gorgeous song that I hadn't listened to in a long time - it randomly came back up on shuffle recently, and I got to re-experience it as if for the first time. 
        The whole album is wonderfully nostalgic for me in the best way - something about it reminds me of swirling sunny afternoons, bunking off class to go on long and meandering walks through the countryside. 
        The band has never been the same again after the loss of Spencer Smith's powerful drum lines driving the songs forwards, and I'll always miss the other albums we could've had. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The second song I've gone for is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5LLCNZ9TPe6X7BCRUMWBY2?si=0c0512747de74388">I Want You (Fever)</a> by Momma, a song that just came out last month! 
        The single has me very excited about the release of their new album next month. The song has this almost-dreamy feeling to it, with slightly dissonant guitars and whipping synths that I really adore. 
        It feels like a song from some sort of wonderful 90s lesbian rom-com, and like I'm the main character. 
        I love the mix of a throw-back but also the way it's new and fresh to me. Looking backwards & forwards in one. 
        The chorus is simple but powerful, and I found myself bouncing uncontrollably to it like a stupid yo-yo so I think that earns it a place on this week's song of the week!
