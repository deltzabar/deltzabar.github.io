      <h3>10 Pointless Facts About Me</h3>

      <p>My friend Abi very kindly suggested that I make a post asking the same questions as she did in her <a href="https://www.akpain.net/blog/ten-pointless-facts/">blog post</a>, so I of course have made a blog just to be able to comply. Alright, let's go.</p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Do you floss your teeth?</h4>

      <p>As with everything, I go through phases. Sometimes I'm really on a roll for it, sometimes I forget. Ain't that life.</p>

      <h4>Tea, coffee, or water?</h4>

      <p>Never coffee --- I love everything coffee flavoured (especially coffee cake), but I cannot stand any coffee apart from, under weather-oppressive circumstances, a Dunkin' iced coffee. Although, that's really stretching the definition of coffee. Generally, I drink enormous amounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte_Le%C3%A3o">Matte Le√£o</a>. For a while I was going through 2-3 teabags per cup but I have attempted to cut back. It's not technically tea --- it's made from yerba mate (very popular across Latin American if you're not familiar with it), which has a particular bitter and smokey taste that I'm a big fan of (and much, much more caffeine than regular tea).</p>

      <h4>Footwear preference?</h4>

      <p>I generally wear the exact same pair of shoes every single day. I believe they are the <a href="https://www.newrock.com/en/ankle-boot-black-imperfect-tank-with-laces-m-tank106-c2">TANK106-C2</a> from New Rock (catchy, I know). I've ping-ponged through a number of pairs of similar platform boots for the past 6 or so years, but I've settled on New Rocks as they're by far the most comfortable and hard-wearing. I will say, the major risk of this is that when people see me inside of houses they get shocked by what I like to call my "inside height", which is about 4 inches shorter than people are familiar with. It's good to keep 'em guessing.</p>

      <p>Side Note: I had been sure that I was probably doing horrific things to my joints and so forth from wearing these heavy-ass platform shoes constantly, but I recently saw a physio who approved them and said they're much better for me than "regular" shoes, because they have a big stable base, and the weight helps with proprioception. So, I suppose I'd accidentally settled on the right thing for me after all!</p>

      <h4>Favourite dessert?</h4>

      <p>This is a tricky one.... I'll probably come up with something better right as soon as I post this, but the dessert I'm always dreaming of is a "casadinho" cake my aunt always gets when I'm in Brasil. It's a very light cake, and it's just a perfectly-balanced understated cake to me. The blend of light whipped doce de leite, the floral note of lime zest, and the dusting of icing sugar on top all come together to be more than the sum of their simple parts --- perfect, given the name "casadinho" means "little married ones".</p>

      <p>I'm also very partial to a lot of chinese bakery items --- I get very excited when I see sesame balls with red bean paste in my local store, as well as coconut cream buns. The definition of not too sweet!</p>

      <h4>The first thing you do when you wake up?</h4>

      <p>Snooze my alarm and go back to sleep....</p>

      <h4>Age you'd like to stick at?</h4>

      <p>I'm going to echo Abi here, and say I don't think I've experienced enough of the options yet...</p>

      <h4>How many hats do you own?</h4>

      <p>I think just the one, which I crocheted. I don't really ever wear it though --- if it's terribly cold, I'm much more of a fan of the sort of hood situation I also crocheted. Much warmer, and it has little devil horns on it :)</p>

      <h4>Describe the last photo you took?</h4>

      <p>The last photo I took was of the no-chicken noodle soup Anna and I made for soup Sunday. I'm a horrible photographer (shaky hands, no patience) and I don't take terribly many photos, so it ends up mostly the occasional plant photo, and then pictures of food to discuss with my mother... I was taught to take photos like you shoot a gun, but I fear I don't have the eye for photos enough for it to be worth the effort! </p>

      <h4>Worst TV show?</h4>

      <p>I'm normally a really big fan of bad TV so it's hard to think of something that's bad in a way I actually don't enjoy it --- that combined with the fact I've watched probably 2 episodes of TV in the past 3 months makes this a terribly difficult question. I suppose I have to say the Traitors; every year when it's Traitors season I have to hear everybody discuss it, and it pisses me off too greatly how horrible of a premise I believe it to be, how horrible the logic everybody on the show employs, AND I have to see Claudia who irrationally annoys me. It's not her fault, but she annoys my nonetheless.</p>

      <h4>As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?</h4>

      <p>Hmm... I remember wanting to be an archaeologist as a kid (somewhat related to enjoying getting to spell it, little nerd), and then an astronaut. Once I read a book about space and found out you had to pee in your spacesuit that ruined the dream!</p>

      <hr>

      <p>I hope I have answered these questions satisfactorily, and have injected the appropriate levels of whimsy into this yet-nascent blog. Let me know if you have beef with any of my answers ;)</p>
