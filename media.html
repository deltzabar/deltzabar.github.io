        In a marrying of my current project on theoretical cryptography with how much time I have spent with proof assistants recently I have been reading about the links between the two. 
        I am especially interested in bridging the gap between theoretical and real-world security, and understanding of to what extent the two are actually correlated.

    <h3>Music</h3>

    <p>
        Inspired (blatantly stolen) from my wonderful friend <a href="https://anna-maths.xyz/">Anna</a>, I am going to try my best to update my song of the week :) This list aims to collect songs that feel like they're going to kick their way out of my chest when I listen to them. If I also end up looking really stupid dancing to them at the bus stop because I literally cannot stop myself that is often a corollary.

      Alright, so, there isn't really a theme or a long story for this week, to be honest. But there <em>was</em> one song that really stood out to me due to how I listened to it 1 william times both this week and last week. So, that's the song of the week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6CoilzKoYntsgLtOiQfHGl?si=887f3d5ab9514914">Dump No Waste, Flows to the Sea</a> by Office Dog is probably my current favourite song right now. I fear I somewhat mislead Anna by suggesting that I don't like morose songs because I definitely do - this is one of them, in my opinion. I don't know, it's hard to define. It's the same with most things, though. Opinion comes first and categorisation comes second, so categorisation remains forever fallible, trying to capture the ineffability of opinion. But, also, this song is sad in a way I really enjoy. It's big, and filled with emotion, and dramatic. It itches something very specific in my brain, and I can easily listen to it 5 times in a row without getting bored. Each time it finishes I want to go again, I want to experience the journey of the song all the way through again.

      The whole <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1CZ2k0z8f02fD12rOrLX08?si=qSSz1G2cSEKvJRBlasJ3PQ">Doggerland</a> EP is fantastic. It's actually really annoying to keep finding really great EPs because, contrary to what their name suggests, they are not particularly extended actually. Intact is a fantastically modulated song, knowing when to be quiet and still, and when to be loud and a lot. I am very excited to listen to their sophomore album whenever it does come out (hopefully soon). But, yes, the EP. It's not a strictly narrative album in the same way as, say Ziggy Stardust is or Danger Days, but it's <em>thematic</em>. To steal from the band's <a href="https://officedog.bandcamp.com/album/doggerland">bandcamp</a>, "Doggerland is a collection of songs about loss and the journey to surfacing again." Which is unfortunately on-theme right now, and they've done a great job of it. It's beautiful and accurate and also just great music.

      As I said, there isn't really a theme this week, but I have more to write about nonetheless, worry not. My back up song this week was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3tLolIaNbQSoIv6Usvhboh?si=9f1c0e12573746f1">(Nothing But) Flowers</a> by Talking Heads. I was thinking about favourite songs, and the nature of such. This was also somewhat precipitated by the same thing that meant this post is so late (the hackathon I was at all weekend). At some point in the middle of the night all of my team were listening to music on a jam together (good vibes!) and we ended up with a lot of Talking Heads on there. (Nothing But) Flowers is probably one of the first songs to ever be my favourite song, which is a funny thing to think about. Your first favourite. It was probably either that or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/25yQPHgC35WNnnOUqFhgVR?si=54380f0952c842a7">Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</a>, which still remains one of my favourites too. Anyway, (Nothing But) Flowers is a fantastically fun song, both musically and lyrically. It takes a critical eye to environmentalism, discussing humanity's unwillingness to compromise the ease of life for a better world, doing so in a clever way. I loved it so much as a kid (because it was joyful and silly), and I love it a lot still now. It captures so well the way that I feel, often. My dream is to move out to the middle of nowhere and farm my own food and never close the windows in my house - or is it? I mean, I love taking buses and going to grocery stores (this is completely genuine). I like the ease of you know, warm-ish showers (well ok I like mine fairly cold) and pizza, upon occasion. And I don't need to say anything else about that, because (Nothing But) Flowers already did that for me. Big wins, I like it a lot.

      Ok, great chat, see y'all next week :)

<h3>Movies & TV</h3>

<p>Under construction. My top favourite tv shows are Interview with the Vampire, Riverdale and Bob's Burgers, and I mostly have a lot to say about the first two. Yes I am serious about Riverdale, I think it is a masterpiece, not even worth arguing about it. Will update this to add some essays, maybe.</p>

<p>Regarding movies I am actually so bad at watching them but the past month I've watched LOADS that are good and a couple that were really awful (which is also fun). You may view my opinions on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/crypt0nomicon/films/reviews/">letterboxd dot com</a>.</p>
