    <h3>Papers</h3>
    <p>
        I am especially interested in bridging the gap between theoretical and real-world security from a cryptographic perspective, and exploration of the extent to which the two are actually correlated. I also have an interest in proof assistants and their applications to cryptography.

    <h3>Music</h3>

    <p>
        Inspired (blatantly stolen) from my wonderful friend <a href="https://anna-maths.xyz/media/song-archive">Anna</a>, I am going to try my best to update my song of the week :) This list aims to collect songs that feel like they're going to kick their way out of my chest when I listen to them. If I also end up looking really stupid dancing to them at the bus stop because I literally cannot stop myself that is often a corollary. 
    </p>

<p>Was busy yesterday and forgot, and then will continue to be busy for much of this week so I am quickly writing what will (hopefully) be a short little song of the week. My theme this week is covers, inspired by a fun one that came up on my Discover Weekly. Just this week Anna was discussing how she often doesn&#39;t like covers because, &quot;I like the original&quot;, so hopefully she will not get pissed off by my choices here. This does allow us to discuss what makes a good cover; I propose 3 key factors, at least one of which must be present. (1) The cover is unequivocally better than the original (think Johnny Cash&#39;s take on Hurt). (2) The original sucks, so any other take on it is an improvement. (We will see one of these). (3) The two are so different such that both are good and fun versions to exist. Much of what I listen to falls into either (2) or (3), because my main interface with covers is the Punk Goes Pop series of albums released by Fearless Records, all of which feature covers of pop songs by bands I am much more likely to enjoy. They&#39;re great fun, and generally either save a mediocre song or provide a new fun take. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1xeMq87xBMSLpjXo85jIOQ?si=8dcfed171882426d">Country Roads</a> by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes: As they describe themselves, they are &quot;punk&#39;s premier cover artists&quot;, and this is a great example. Ramone-style fast and short songs that give you fun takes on old classics. Their take on Jolene is a lot of fun too, I really like it</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6xlw54GYOkwMqpSPcufLfm?si=9fcba5a2e2a646ca">Tell Her Tonight</a> by Cornbread Red from the Pickin&#39; on Series: I was introduced to this by my Dad, because of course I was. He loves covers, he loves Franz Ferdinand, and he loves bluegrass. It&#39;s a great album, but I think this one is my favourite off of it. Again, this is one where I really like the original but this is a really fun different take, and it&#39;s also just a really nice chill song to listen to. </li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1YAaQWEJKr9sZ5ZAQAHSPI?si=e635533a58c84794">Thunderstorms and Neon Signs</a> by Wayne Hancock: Random interjection sorry, not a cover. BUT! I&#39;ve been listening to it a lot this week and it&#39;s just so much fun, you&#39;ve got to give it a listen. Wow I love country music. </li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0n3sHHfdOq6Awix3JPe3xl?si=a2d0be0c5c984d87">Bad Romance</a> by Halestorm is THE definitive cover of all time. I previously mentioned my love for Halestorm and <em>The Strange Case of...</em>, and this takes that flair but applies it to Gaga, who I already love. They&#39;re such a dramatic and over-the-top band, and it just works perfectly in tandem on this track. So so much fun and when I&#39;m out in public listening to this track I can never stop myself from doing a little strut and dance to it.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/35FZulR4L8REIjU0u1pw1k?si=a9f1d4bcdad649e7">Karma Police</a> by Pierce the Veil is on the new deluxe release of <em>The Jaws of Life</em> that came out this month. Pierce the Veil are frequently the band that produce the best tracks on Punk Goes Pop (I especially like their take on Just the Way You Are), so I really enjoyed this cover being included on the deluxe release. Also, I just really like Pierce the Veil (did you see they&#39;re touring this year with Cavetown as the opener?!? That&#39;s crazy?! Like I really like both of them but I am shocked the overlap is big enough that they made that decision!?? That being said if any other readers really like one/both of them please let me know I&#39;d love to see this show (sorry, gig) it sounds crazy and good). Anyway, I think Vic Fuentes&#39; whiny voice works great on this track and really gives it that Radiohead-y emotional oomph, but in a different and fun way. Also, I really like how they&#39;ve used electric guitar on this track, especially near the end where it just dissolves into noise. Just so great! Yay! I love Pierce the Veil wow! &lt;-- This one is my song of the week</li>

<h3>Movies & TV</h3>

<p>Under construction. My top favourite tv shows are Interview with the Vampire, Riverdale and Bob's Burgers, and I mostly have a lot to say about the first two. Yes I am serious about Riverdale, I think it is a masterpiece, not even worth arguing about it. Will update this to add some essays, maybe.</p>

<p>Regarding movies I am actually so bad at watching them but the past month I've watched LOADS that are good and a couple that were really awful (which is also fun). You may view my opinions on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/crypt0nomicon/films/reviews/">letterboxd dot com</a>.</p>
