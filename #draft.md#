themes:

- politics
- non-standard gendered performances
- comfort

chop suey! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSvFpBOe8eY&rco=1
- my introduction to metal music! i was a fan of this before i got into BMTH
- (you can skip psat the warning)
- weird and nonsensical dada-esque lyrics
- older than me! from 2001
- weird trippy fun video is very memorable to me
- while this is the one i was a big fan of, i want to talk about their other music & serj tankian as a person too
- this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo5JVuW4_qk was really good
- as i've been thinking about since last week, the intersection of politics and music. he says it made the band better, because it gave them a "push and pull"
- discuss his advocacy for the armenian genocide, family's experience, etc
- impressive how popular this song is nowadays, given it got basically no airplay --- the name was changed to chop suey from the original name, suicide, but it still ended up on the list of songs that were "lyircally questionable"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Channel_memorandum The list is pretty funny and I'd encourage you to take a scroll through. A few things I especially enjoy on the list are "Rocketman" and "Bennie and the Jets" both making it on there, and the blanket inclusion of all of Rage Against the Machine's music. Oh, and Walk Like an Egyptian making it on the list because the main plane hijacker was Egyptian.
- Discuss some of the more explicitly political songs, such as Police Song and BYOB
- talk a bit more about the track itself

king for a day https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icXUkIfZxyg
- vic fuentes hair (side note about my obsession with long hair)
- the screaming that opens the song immediately makes me feel relaxed and present
- somewhat of a common music video theme, but done really well and a fun story, i love sticking it to the man and making bank robbery cool again
- just gorgeous vocals, drums, everything
- kellan!
- again this is the best example here (although maybe mention AFI as an even better one), but gender roles/ performances/ etc

gives you hell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxUATkpMQ8A
- suuuuch an iconic music video for me!!!
- even though i was probably more like th ebuttoned up version, the freedom and imagining i was the other one meant a lot to me
- i hear all-american rejects are back and only playing house parties!! what fun
- i have the sleep schedule of the other one though
- like, genuinely, i think it was healthy for me to find it cooler to break rules because it was something i struggled with lol and it's very good for you
- tyson ritter

the middle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKsxPW6i3pM
- an incredibly important song to me as a kid because of it's message, which is also conveyed really well through the music video
- the lyrics tell you, "just be yourself/ doesn't matter if it's good enough/ for someone else"
- echoed in the video, which shows a kid who doesn't fit in properly with everybody else, put off by people's nakedness and making out
- as someone who reached a point in my teen years where it felt like people were growing up and becoming these mature people interested in sex, and i wasn't, it was a great solace
- apparently written for a 13 year old who wrote into the band about not fitting in!

fat lip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMX2lPum_pg
- absolutely ELECTRIC video, that dials up the crazy fun song to another level
- just what a joy! all these weirdos dancing and hanging out together
- i also think it's worth noting that this genre can be really white, and i really enjoyed as a kid having a role model who wasn't in sum 41!
- yeah not so much to say it's just so so fun

early sunsets over monroeville https://open.spotify.com/track/2aHqdN4K9naX3oBuUxp6zf?si=1ec4f85b8d754934
- yes yes i know my theme throughout has been music videos and this doesn't even have one!
- however, this theme is more properly about songs that meant a lot to me when i was first getting into music, for a number of different reasons
- bullets has been my favourite my chem album for a really long time, and not just because i'm a contrarian (lol)
- i really like the fact that it came out the same year i was born, it's a fun connection to exist between us. it's older than me though!
- it's definitely the most heavy & raw album, with a lot of screaming (which we all know i really like). however, this opens with his calming guitar melody that i think just balances it so perfectly. it's like you can feel all the stress leaving you as it starts
- actually, fun fact, i've discussed my relationship with reddit for how it connected me to communities around bands i liked and how that was mostly centred around my love for top and my chem --- my reddit username is one of the songs on this album! i won't tell you whcih one though
- reddit story that i spent ages trying to find, of th eperson who was taken to a my chem concert by their babysitter, and gerard played this song as a lullaby to get them to sleep
- BUT DOES ANYONE NOTICE!!!! THERE'S A CORPSE IN THIS BED!!!
- i also think, all of the songs i've mentioned thus far were discovered through my primary way of finding music at this age --- borrowing a laptop from the library after school and then typing "emo music" into the youtube search bar. this song, to me, represents when i branched out from that and found music that i really really loved myself. it's also, thus, notable that unlike the other songs mentioned it's not my chem's most popular song! a lot of the other bands, i am still only a fan of their top 3 or 4 songs, because that's just what came up at the time and thus what i got that attachment too
- actually, i vividly remember the first time i listened to my chemical romance... i remember that it kind of scared me! i don't know why. but i remember, with my kindle fire, clicking on them for the first time to listen through their music. i probably started with danger days because it was their most recent album. i felt all hot and weird, and desperately excited. i really wanted to like their music. and i did!
